# NonMaxSuppression class 
Here, you will dicover two main function isNearEdge and softNonMaxSuppression.
## First we will talk about isNearEdge
### isNearEdge is function that check if the result bounding box near on the edge, it deletes the result near the edge.
### So why? Why we decided to do hillarious things like that? When we use AR to cropping image we decided cropping image bigger than the actual one <br />
### so the hallucination result would likely to appear on the edge of the image

## Next, softNonMaxSuppression
### Soft Non Max Suppression also known as Soft-NMS, It is method used to filter halucinate result and the next level of Non Max Suppression.
### Soft-NMS is method sorting the result based on their score and intersection over union(IOU), It will decay score of hallucinate result to be lower than our theshold

Let deep dive in Soft-NMS method <br />
Soft-NMS is filter hallucinate result that overlap the actual result like the following image:

### We have 3 method that you can choose 
- Linear decay
- Gaussian decay
- Regular NMS

### Linear Soft-NMS
If IOU value is more than IOU theshold we will decay score of item by using following equation

If New score is less than theshold, the result may be hallucinate.

### Gaussian Soft-NMS
If two bounding box overlap each other, Gaussian Soft-NMS will decay score of the item by using gaussian decay <br />
Note: This method no need IOU theshold. <br />
<img src="/explain_class/Readme_Assets/equ3.JPG"> <br />
If New score is less than theshold, the result may be hallucinate.


### Regular NMS
If two bounding box have IOU value more than IOU theshold, It will be delete. <br />

So we decided to choose gaussian due to it flexible method. <br />

If you would like to try our three method for Non max suppression. We leave the link to our [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1e2Ca3UQv5cl2Z5NK1CMUYllE0YIj8Vfy?usp=sharing) and our [code](https://github.com/KIBO-Astronut/5th-KIBO/blob/main/explain_class/colab_playground/code/NMS_playground.ipynb) for you <br />
If you want more infomation, let's leave it in the discussion.
